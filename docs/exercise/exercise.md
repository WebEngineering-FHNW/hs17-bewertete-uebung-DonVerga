Other comments: This task was a challenge for me. Sadly I did understand to work with grails today. 
I was struggeling a lot while trying to make this basic task on the framework. I had to start over
2 times because it started to give me infinite errors and i did not even know why...
I am a bit disappointed because I could not implement everything I wanted to. 


I'm particular proud of:
I learned a lot about working with grails. 
Specially proud that it does what I wanted to do.
